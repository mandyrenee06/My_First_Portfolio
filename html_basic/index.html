  <h1>Welcome to My Cool Webpage</h1>

  <p>This is my first real webpage created from scratch using HTML. I am learning how to build webpages step by step.</p>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>

  <p>This section explains the purpose of the page. It contains headings, paragraphs, and even an image that you can click.</p>

  <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>

  <p>Each task helps me understand HTML better. I am learning about structure, tags, elements, and how browsers read webpages.</p>

  <p>With time, I will be able to build more advanced websites with CSS and JavaScript!</p>
